\subsection{Scope of Engagement}
    % Include a short (3 - 4 sentences) explanation of the scope, ensure that any limitations to the scope are mentioned.
    % An example is included below:
    The full scope of this penetration test was limited to the following CIDR range.  At the request of \cptc\ , the first day of the engagement (Jan 7 2022) excluded hosts 10.0.17.50 and 10.0.17.51 in order to ensure availability of critical infrastructure.  These hosts were included on the second day (Jan 8th starting at 9:20AM) to ensure proper testing.  Care was taken by \teamname\ to ensure penetration test activity did not reduce the availability of industrial systems.
    
    % List in scope subnet(s) in CIDR notation.
    % An example is included below:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 10.0.17.0/24 
    \end{itemize}

    % Include a short (3-4 sentences) non-technical explanation of how the team handled the scope and ensure the client that no actions were taken exceeding what is documented herein.
    % An example is included below:
    The penetration test was conducted with extreme care to ensure actions were contained within the defined scope. Additionally, because the engagement was within a production environment, the team ensured that no services were disrupted. \teamname\ did not exfiltrate, modify, or delete any data not included in this report. 

    % If your team would like to continue their relationship with this client, for example if you would like to offer the client further services such as deploying improved security, this is the place to do so.
    % An example is included below:
    \teamname\ is available upon request to improve the security, protect the employees, and customers of \cptc. This includes verifying and validating implemented mitigation techniques as well as deploying security strategies to ensure \cptc\ has several layers of defense. The team is happy to continue a partnership with \cptc\ and excited to work along side them in securing their operations.
