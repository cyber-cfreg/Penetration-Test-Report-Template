\section{Conclusion}
    \cptc\ provides the community with delicious confections.  The stability and integrity of the system that provides pastries is necessary to maintaining the luxuries of modern life.  It is for this reason that the threats outlined in this report should be taken seriously and immediately remedied. The gravity of the vulnerabilities described above cannot be understated. An attacker with the same level of access as what \teamname\ was granted for this engagement could gain direct control of the industrial control systems of \cptc 's factory. If this were to happen in an uncontrolled setting, the vulnerabilities would be so grave that \cptc\ might be liable for negligence in the result of loss of life and externalities as a result of such an attack. Additionally, \cptc\ may incur penalties for violations of PCI DSS requirements.
    
    \teamname\ hopes that this relationship with \cptc\ will continue in the future.  We look forward to working together to ensure the vulnerabilities discussed in this report are properly remediated and to help continually improve \cptc's security posture.
