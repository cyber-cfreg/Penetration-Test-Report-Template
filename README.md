## Penetration Testing Report Template 

This repository is a template that can be used by anyone for writing Penetration Test reports. This example was solely created for an example in LaTeX. The reason for this is management for LaTeX is much easier for larger document (e.g managing references). This template has been used over the years for [GlobalCPTC](https://cp.tc/) and has made our reports standout.

Other penetration test reports can be found at GlobalCPTC's [GitHub](https://github.com/nationalcptc/report_examples). By no means is this report template is perfect but it meant to help people who are not familiar with LaTeX learn it. After gaining familiarity with LaTex you will most likely not want to use Microsoft Word ever again. We hope this is helpful!

## Usage
You can use a local compiler for this document however, collaboration is usually important if you plan to use this for an ethical hacking class or competition.
